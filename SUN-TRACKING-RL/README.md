# Sun Tracker RL

This project trains a controller to point a 2-axis dish toward the Sun (and other sky objects) using Reinforcement Learning. We build a lightweight simulation (Gymnasium) and implement an RL policy.

## Goals
- Simulate dish + sun motion with basic physics.
- Train an RL agent to minimize pointing error.
- Compare RL vs other methods.
- (Optional) Implement 3D graphics for better visuals
